# Garden Store Inventory Analysis

## Project Overview

Welcome to the repository for Petal Power, a popular chain of gardening stores. As the lead data analyst, your task is to help Petal Power manage and analyze their inventory data. This project utilizes pandas to manipulate inventory data and provides insights into product availability, inventory value, and detailed descriptions for a marketing catalog.

## Project Goals

The primary objective of this project is to assist Petal Power in:

- Analyzing inventory across different store locations.
- Responding to customer inquiries regarding product availability.
- Calculating the total value of the inventory currently in stock.
- Generating comprehensive product descriptions for the marketing department.

## How to Use

To analyze the inventory, we load the data, perform various data manipulation operations, and create new columns that provide valuable insights:

1. Load inventory data into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Inspect and select specific portions of the data related to different locations.
3. Calculate and add new columns to the DataFrame to extend its functionality.
